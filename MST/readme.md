This folder contains information for the MST version of this assignment

Before importing the database dump file, you will need to create a schema/database named mst_fast.

The database contains data for one problem with 500 locations and the distances between each of the distinct 124,750 paris of locations.  A fast algorithm can compute the MST in less than one second.

If you choose to use the MSTFastDevAlt.py development environment, then you will also need to load the database from the MSTFastAlt.sql dump file.
