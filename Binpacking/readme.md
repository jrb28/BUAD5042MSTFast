This folder contains data for the Binpacking version of this assignment.

Before importing the database you will need to create a schema/database named binpacking_fast.

The database contains data for two problems.  The first problem has 20,000 items to be packed into bins and the second problem 100,000 items to be packed.   My algorithm can solve the first problem in about 15 seconds and the second problem in a little over 7 minutes.
