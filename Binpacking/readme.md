This folder contains data for the Binpacking version of this assignment.

Before importing the database you will need to create a schema/database named binpacking_fast.

The database contains data for two problems.  The first problem has 20,000 items to be packed into bins and the second problem 100,000 items to be packed.   

I've posed execution times for two algorithms: the first is a relatively simple approach and the second a more complex approach.  The execution times for the first algorithm are 15 seconds for the first problem and about 7 minutes for the second problem.  The latter algorithm has execution times of 0.757 seconds and 8.427 seconds.
